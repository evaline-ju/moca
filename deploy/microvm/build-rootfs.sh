# deploy/microvm/build-rootfs.sh
#
# Turns the P6 sandbox IMAGE's filesystem into a directory tree for
# `build-snapshot.sh --rootfs`, so a microVM built from it carries the same toolchain the
# container tier does (bash, coreutils, findutils, file, git, python3, rg -- see
# remote-worker/Dockerfile). It only READS the image: `podman create` + `podman export`, then
# the temporary container is removed. build-snapshot.sh layers the guest agent and its init
# on top; nothing here adds either.
#
# Usage:
#   sudo deploy/microvm/build-rootfs.sh --out /srv/rootfs/moca-sandbox [--image REF]
#
# Root because the image's files have owners (the /workspace mount point is 1001:0, most of
# the tree root:0) and the snapshot's rootfs must keep them; a non-root extraction would
# silently re-own everything to the caller. Root also finds the image where setup-vm.sh put
# it: in root's podman storage.
