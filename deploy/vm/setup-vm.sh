# Bring up the P6 single-VM deployment: Redis, relay, sandbox containers, control plane and
# supervisor units.
# Sibling of deploy/knative/setup-kind.sh and setup-ocp.sh (spec §4.4).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - a Linux VM with systemd 247+ (LoadCredential=) and podman, Node 22+
#   - run as a user that can sudo to root (installs units under /etc/systemd/system)
#
# Usage:
#   ./deploy/vm/setup-vm.sh
#
# Env overrides:
#   SH_UNIT_DIR       Where systemd unit files are installed (default /etc/systemd/system)
#   SH_ENV_DIR        Where the supervisor/relay/control-plane env files live (default
#                       /etc/serverless-harness)
#   SH_CRED_DIR       TEST-ONLY. Where the MU1 secrets are written as root-only files (default
#                       $SH_ENV_DIR/credentials). The units' LoadCredential= lines hardcode
#                       /etc/serverless-harness/credentials, so any other value on a real host yields
#                       units that cannot start.
#   SH_INSTALL_DIR    Where the harness checkout lives on the VM (default /opt/serverless-harness)
#   SH_SANDBOX_COUNT     Number of sandbox containers to start (default 2)
#   SANDBOX_IMAGE        Sandbox container image (default
#                          ghcr.io/rossoctl/moca-remote-worker:latest, the image
#                          that attaches to the relay -- compose's sandbox image too)
#   SH_SANDBOX_RELAY_ADDR  Address each sandbox container uses to dial the relay (default
#                          host.containers.internal:<SH_RELAY_PORT from relay.env>). Reaching
#                          the host from inside a container is the part of this script least
#                          verified on real hardware -- override this if the default does not
#                          resolve on your VM (see deploy/vm/README.md). install_sandbox_firewall
#                          opens the port from THIS address, not SH_RELAY_PORT unconditionally,
#                          so overriding it also changes which port the firewall opens.
#   MOCA_SANDBOX_SUBNET    Dedicated podman network subnet for sandbox containers (default
#                          10.89.40.0/24). MI1 R8: sandboxes no longer share the default podman
#                          network, so the firewall below can name this subnet precisely.
#   MOCA_SANDBOX_GATEWAY   Gateway address on that subnet (default 10.89.40.1); also what
#                          host.containers.internal resolves to inside a sandbox container.
#   MOCA_SANDBOX_BRIDGE    Name of that network's bridge interface (default moca-sandbox0, at most
#                          15 characters). The firewall matches sandbox traffic by the bridge it
#                          arrives on, so it covers every address family, IPv6 link-local included.
#
# Control-plane settings (optional; written into control-plane.env only where it has none yet --
# an existing value is kept, with a warning if these disagree). sudo drops the environment, so pass
# them through it: sudo env SH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=Ov23li... SH_PUBLIC_HARNESS_URL=... ./deploy/vm/setup-vm.sh
#   SH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID    A GitHub OAuth app's client id, device flow ENABLED (deploy/vm/README.md,
#                          "The GitHub OAuth app"). No client secret: the device flow needs none.
#   SH_PUBLIC_HARNESS_URL  The harness as clients reach it, advertised by GET /v1/discovery; behind
#                          the default SSH tunnel, http://127.0.0.1:8080.

  # (env/supervisor.env.example), and select-sandbox.ts honours that by never listing pods:
  # `const pods = source === 'records' ? [] : await list(...)`. So the only inventory of executors is
  # a set of Redis records. Anyone who can write to Redis chooses the sandbox every turn dispatches
  # to -- receiving the user's prompts and repository contents and returning whatever they like as
  # the agent's output. Admission control, the fail-closed relay token and RestrictAddressFamilies on
  # both units are all bypassed, because none of them is in that path.
  #
  # Nothing loses access: both env templates already point at redis://127.0.0.1:6379, and the sandbox

  # are lost on every reboot and on every `podman rm` of this container. That is acceptable only

  # anyway. It is stated here (and in README.md's "What round one does not claim") rather than left
