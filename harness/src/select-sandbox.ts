/**
 * Process-wide Redis-backed stores, reused across selections instead of built per call.
 *
 * Both stores used to be constructed inside `selectPoolSandbox` on every call. That was harmless
 * while only prompt leaves reached this code — a leaf is a process, so "per call" was "once". The
 * moment `/turn` began selecting from the pool it became per TURN, and the two failed differently:
 *
 *  - `RedisRecordStore` was constructed AND closed, so it churned: measured on a real run, ~10k
 *    turns produced **35,654** connections.
 *  - `RedisLeaseStore` was constructed and **never closed** (its constructor connects eagerly), so
 *    it LEAKED one live connection per turn — monotonically, to the `maxclients 10000` ceiling.
 *
 * Redis then answered `ERR max number of clients reached`, node-redis raised that as an `'error'`
 * event on a client with no listener, and all four workers exited code 1 **simultaneously**,
 * mid-rung, stranding every in-flight turn (the driver's own curl has no timeout, so those turns
 * hung indefinitely rather than failing). It took ~13 minutes at 27-54 turns/s to accumulate, which
 * is why two complete E8 ladders passed before it appeared.
 *
 * Each memo holds the STORE, not a promise of one, and is dropped when a call through it rejects:
 * caching a broken client would turn one transient Redis blip into a permanent failure for the life
 * of the process — for the record store a permanent "no sandboxes", for the lease store a permanent
 * inability to acquire. Neither is closed on the happy path; they are process-lived by design and
 * the process exiting is what releases them.

/**
 * The wrapper resolves the memo PER COMMAND, not once when the wrapper is built.
 *
 * That distinction is the whole point, because `selectPoolSandbox` hands its caller CLOSURES over
 * this wrapper (`heartbeat`/`release`, below) and every caller ticks them for the life of the turn or
 * leaf — `run-leaf.ts`'s three `setInterval`s, `run-turn.ts`'s renewal. Binding one store instance
 * here meant those closures could not see the memo's own recovery: `dropMemo` closes the failed store
 * and clears the memo, the next `selectPoolSandbox` gets a healthy one, but the captured closure still
 * points at the closed client — whose every command rejects `ClientClosedError` for the life of the
 * process, and whose further drops are no-ops because `dropMemo` identity-checks against a memo that
 * now holds a different store.
 *
 * A one-command blip therefore cost the lease for the entire turn: renewals stop, the TTL lapses, and
 * the pod goes back in the pool while the turn is still executing in it — over-subscribing the soft
 * cap `ACQUIRE_LUA` enforces. Each later tick was also a fresh rejection, which is what made an
 * unguarded `void lease.heartbeat()` a repeat process-killer rather than a one-off.
 *
 * Recovery deliberately comes from the memo and NOT from an `arm()`/`open()` re-arm inside
 * `RedisLeaseStore` (the shape `RedisSessionBackend`, `RedisWorkQueue` and `RedisResultStore` use).
 * Those four are memoised for the process's life and never closed on any path that keeps using them,
 * so reconnecting in place is right there. This store is different: `dropMemo` CLOSES it on purpose,
 * and node-redis will happily reopen a closed client (probed on the pinned redis 6.2.1 — `close()`
 * then `connect()` yields `isOpen: true` and PINGs). A re-arm would therefore resurrect a store that
 * no memo references and nothing will ever close again: one orphaned connection per outage, in the
 * code that exists to keep connections off the `maxclients` ceiling. Re-entering the memo has the
 * self-healing without the orphan, and it makes the exemption `redis-errors.ts` claims for these two
 * stores unconditional — it no longer depends on the caller re-entering `sharedLease()` by hand.

/**

 *
 *  - **It could drop a healthy store.** A command on store₁ hangs; `REDIS_URL` changes (or
 *    `resetSharedStores` runs) and the memo is rebuilt with a healthy store₂; store₁'s command
 *    finally rejects and the drop discards **store₂**, which never failed. The next call builds
 *    store₃ and store₂ is orphaned — connected, unreferenced, never closed. The window is small, but
 *    it is exactly the situation the guard exists for (Redis misbehaving, commands in flight), and
 *    under a flapping Redis it chains.
 *  - **It leaked the store it dropped.** The memo was the last reference, so nulling it alone
 *    abandons a live connection — one per distinct failure, permanently, in the code whose purpose is
 *    keeping connections from accumulating to `maxclients`. The URL-change path four lines up already
 *    closes for this reason; the failure path deserves it more, being the one that can fire
 *    repeatedly.
 *
 * Closing is safe even though the store is SHARED with concurrent callers: redis 6's `close()` is
 * documented as "Close the client. Wait for pending commands" (`destroy()` is the one that rejects
 * them), so in-flight commands drain rather than failing. And no NEW caller can reach this store —
 * the memo is cleared first, so the next `shared*()` builds a fresh one.
 *
 * Clearing before closing is deliberate, and reuses the shape settled on in #249 (`turn-auth.ts:318`):
 * a throwing close must not be able to skip the rebuild.

 * With a tier given, neither wording is used: both would be untrue. Pods are never candidates for a
