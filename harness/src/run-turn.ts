/**
 * One session store per process, not per turn.
 *
 * `executeTurnCore` used to `new RedisSessionBackend(...)` on every call and never close it. Its
 * constructor connects eagerly, so each turn leaked one live Redis connection — and this predates
 * the supervisor, but the supervisor is what makes it fatal: before P6 a turn was served by a
 * Knative container that went away afterwards, whereas a supervisor worker is process-lived and
 * admits S concurrent turns for hours. The leak then climbs to `maxclients` (10000), Redis answers
 * `ERR max number of clients reached`, and node-redis raises that as an `'error'` on a client with
 * no listener, so every worker exits at once. Measured: all four died simultaneously ~13 minutes
 * into a sustained ladder.
 *
 * Sharing is safe because the store is stateless per session — the URL is the only construction
 * input and every method takes the session id — and node-redis multiplexes concurrent commands over
 * one connection.
 *
 * Unlike the stores in select-sandbox.ts there is no drop-on-failure wrapper here, and the reason is
 * that the hazard such a wrapper guards against — memoising a client that never connected — is now
 * fixed at its source instead of worked around at each call site. `RedisSessionBackend` used to
 * assign `ready` once in its constructor and never reassign it, so a rejected `connect()` poisoned
 * every later method call on that instance forever; memoising one process-wide would then have
 * traded a bounded per-turn leak for an unbounded outage, and in the very window the leak never
 * mattered in (the first turn after boot). It now RE-ARMS: a failed attempt clears itself so the
 * next call reconnects (packages/session-backend/src/redis-backend.ts, `arm()`), which fixes it for
 * every caller of the class rather than for this memo alone.
 *
 * Worth knowing which failures reach that path: probed on the pinned redis@6.2.1, both shapes do — a
 * REFUSED connect rejects with `ECONNREFUSED`, and a black-holed SYN rejects once the 5s
 * `connectTimeout` raises `ConnectionTimeoutError`. In a cluster the second is the one to expect: a
 * Service with no ready endpoints, or a NetworkPolicy drop, black-holes the SYN instead of refusing
 * it.
 *
 * The re-arm handles the promise channel. A socket lost AFTER connecting is the event channel, and
 * that one is fatal without an `'error'` listener regardless of any memoisation — hence
 * `swallowRedisErrors`, which every long-lived client here now registers.

 * The id a turn holds its sandbox lease under. Unique per TURN — never the session id.

 * is not a harness concept and that the old lease `runId` was `session_id` under another name. This
 * value is the counter-example that makes the identity real — it MUST differ from the session id, for
 * the two reasons below — so it gets its own descriptive name, as docs/glossary.md prescribes.
 *
 * The holder id is the ZSET *member* in `ACQUIRE_LUA` (sandbox-lease.ts), not a payload, so a repeated
 * value is one lease rather than two: `ZADD` on an existing member updates its score and leaves
 * `ZCARD` unchanged. A session id is stable across every turn of a session by design (that is what
 * lets `:openFromCheckpoint` reopen one), so deriving the holder from it would have made the RESUME
 * path — the one the supervisor exists to serve — the path that shares leases, and broken the pool
 * two ways:
 *
 *  - **The cap undercounts.** N concurrent turns of one session occupy ONE slot, so with
 *    `KAGENTI_SANDBOX_CAP=20` a single session can pile arbitrarily many turns onto one pod while the
 *    pool still reports headroom — deflating the very saturation accounting `SandboxPoolSaturatedError`
 *    and its new 503 are computed from.
 *  - **The first turn to finish releases a sandbox another is still using.** `release` is `zRem`, so
 *    one turn's `finally` removes the shared member while its sibling is mid-execution; the pod then
 *    reads as free for new work, and the sibling's heartbeat (`zAdd`) resurrects the member seconds
 *    later, so `load()` returns a different answer depending on where in the heartbeat interval it is
 *    sampled.
 *
 * The session id is prefixed for greppability only — nothing reads the holder back, and the UUID is
 * what carries the uniqueness. The session id itself still reaches `selectPoolSandbox` separately,
 * because it is what keys the microVM workspace and must stay stable across a session's turns.
 */

/**
 * Decide which sandbox a turn runs its tools in, and lease it when it comes from a pool.
 *
 * A caller that has already leased one (a prompt leaf, which must reach the very sandbox it holds
 * a lease on — including a remote one behind the relay) injects it, and resolution is skipped.
 *
 * `/turn` injects nothing, and this is where its behavior CHANGED. It used to call
 * `resolveSandboxConfig` alone — the single-pod path — so it ignored
 * `KAGENTI_SANDBOX_POOL_SELECTOR`, `SH_SANDBOX_DISCOVERY` and `SH_REMOTE_SANDBOX` entirely, and on
 * a deployment that configured a pool it ran the turn's tool calls in the harness process itself
 * (ADR 0028 deferred this as "prompt leaves inherit /turn's sandbox routing"; run-leaf.ts closed
 * it for leaves only). Proven on hardware: a tool call's file landed in the supervisor unit's own
 * PrivateTmp namespace, never in any sandbox container, while a direct probe of the relay's Exec
 * RPC reached the pool fine at the same moment.
 *
 * Going through `selectPoolSandbox` is what makes the no-pool path safe **by construction** rather
 * than by care: its own first branch is `if (!selector) return resolveSandboxConfig(...)`, i.e.
 * exactly the call this function used to make, with a no-op lease. A deployment with no
 * `KAGENTI_SANDBOX_POOL_SELECTOR` therefore resolves identically to before, and no future caller
 * of `executeTurn` can bypass this seam to get the old behavior back.
 *
 * One intended behavior change beyond routing: with a selector set and NO candidates,
 * `selectPoolSandbox` throws rather than falling back. Previously such a deployment silently ran
 * tools locally, which is the failure §5.4 exists to prevent — a turn that cannot reach the
 * sandbox it is configured to use is not a turn that should quietly succeed.
