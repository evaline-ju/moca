// Issue #304. waitForUnixSocket retried on a FIXED 20 ms sleep, so every restore paid at
// least one full quantum however fast Firecracker actually bound its socket.
//
// Measured on srv-r16b14s16 over 1,625 restores on an idle box: sockwait 24.92 ms of a
// 27.73 ms restore -- 89.9% -- over 2.80 ms of real work (prep 0.22 + wsimg 0.05 + jailer
// 0.39 + loadsnap 2.14). The distribution was quantized with no tail below the quantum:
// min 20.06 ms, ZERO of 1,625 under 20 ms, 78.2% in [20,40), 21.8% in [40,60).
//
// The quantum was a measurement FLOOR, and removing it was worth ~11% on the mean (24.92 ->
// 22.24 ms), NOT the ~5x #304 predicted: the socket genuinely takes ~10-40 ms to bind on that
// host, so most of sockwait was never our sleep. This test pins that the floor is gone, which
