// WorkspaceCapability is the Hello.capabilities entry that tells the harness this worker
// honours Exec.workspace_key with a per-key directory under its workspace root. The
// harness points a session's podCwd at <root>/<session id> ONLY when it sees it, because
// every path it sends is absolute (`cd '/workspace' && …`): changing the directory the
// child starts in, alone, would leave every session writing to the shared tree (#408).
// A worker without it keeps today's single shared workspace on both sides.

//
// NOT A SECURITY BOUNDARY. Same Unix user, same process list, same container: a command
// can `cd ..`. This removes the collision of two sessions cloning into one path and the
// optics of one user's agent seeing another's files. Isolation is MI1 S5 owner binding.
//
// Removal is idle-only (#338: never delete a workspace mid-session). Sweep deletes a
// key's directory once no Exec is running in it and none has started for Idle. Only keys
// this process has run are swept: a restarted worker does not adopt directories it finds
// under Root, because Root is also the shared workspace and its contents (an empty-key
// session's `git clone foo`) are indistinguishable from a key's directory by name.
